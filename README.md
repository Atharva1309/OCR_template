The two python files are specific for the pdf file I have uploaded the 1st file dskew.py is to check the orientation of the image which we get after converting the pdf file into image. The second python file segment.py is used to manipulate the image. I have created a seperate co-ordinate variable for each field I wanted to extract from the image. Then these cropped images are converted into text using Pytesseract and appending each extracted field into a dictionary. At the end, I have dumped this dictionary and its key-value pairs in a json variable.
